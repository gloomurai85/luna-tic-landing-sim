# luna-tic-landing-sim
This mini-project implements LUNA-TIC (Lunar Uncertainty Numerical Analysis – Trajectory Integration & Calculations), a simple 1D Monte Carlo tool for human lunar terminal descent. It integrates the vertical trajectory under uncertain mass, thrust, and burn conditions, then computes basic human-rated safety metrics (g-load and touchdown speed).
